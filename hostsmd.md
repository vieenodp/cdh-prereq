# Hosts

This file contains the information about the IP address / Host name of all hosts in the hadoop cluster. The host file is divided into two section: one for Ambari hadoop installation for HDP or BI and another one for Cloudera hadoop.

### Ambari_hosts
* List of hosts which will be required for installing hadoop cluster of hortanworks or BigInsights over ambari.  
* By default, all services will be installed randomly on the nodes and all clients will be installed on each node. If you want to specify namenode or resource manager services explicitly on some specific node than define the optional variable for that service as shown in below table:  

|          Variable          |                                                 Description                                                 | Required |
